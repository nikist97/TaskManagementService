This project is the end result of a series of tutorials for building a Java REST API that I have publishes on my personal blog - https://nsnotes.hashnode.dev/.

The **master** branch contains the latest version of the project combining all the published tutorials so far. This
particular branch - **in-memory-db-repository** - is the end result of the following blog post - https://nsnotes.hashnode.dev/integrating-a-java-rest-api-with-a-database.
